Component and Inhibitor IDs
====================================================================================

Each gas component, salt, and organic inhibitor is assigned an ID or index order position for
the sake of simplicity. Over time, these lists may be added to, but no existing compound 
should have its ID or index order changed in order to maintain code compatibility.

The IDs for guest components are as follows:

    * 1 - CH4
    * 2 - C2H6
    * 3 - C3H8
    * 4 - c-C3H6
    * 5 - n-C4H10
    * 6 - i-C4H10
    * 7 - C5H12
    * 8 - C6H14
    * 9 - CO2
    * 10 - H2S
    * 11 - N2
    * 12 - O2

The index ordering for salts is as follows:

    * 0 - NaCl
    * 1 - CaCl2
    * 2 - MgCl2
    * 3 - CaBr2
    * 4 - NaBr
    * 5 - KBr
    * 6 - NH4Cl
    * 7 - KHCOO
    * 8 - NaHCOO

The index ordering for organic inhibitors is as follows:

    * 0 - Methanol
    * 1 - Ethanol
    * 2 - Glycol
    * 3 - Monoethylene Glycol
    * 4 - Diethylene Glycol
    * 5 - Triethylene Glycol
